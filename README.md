# Mobile Price Prediction with PyTorch

## Overview
This repository contains a PyTorch-based deep learning model for predicting mobile phone prices based on various features. The dataset used is assumed to be `train.csv`, which includes numerical and categorical attributes of mobile devices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using `pandas` and `sklearn`
- Model training with `torch.nn`
- Uses `DataLoader` for efficient batching
- Implements feature scaling and encoding

## Installation
To set up the project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place `train.csv` in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Mobile_Price_PyTorch.ipynb`.
3. Follow the steps inside the notebook to preprocess the data and train the model.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for a full list of dependencies.
